'Steps':

1. Lay out A
    Jobs:
        a) Place grain in A0
        b) Place grain in A1
        c) Place grain in A2
        d) Place grain in A3
2. Lay out B
    Jobs:
        a) Place grain in B0
        b) Place grain in B1
        c) Place grain in B2
        d) Place grain in B3

For each condition Ai and Bi present:

3. Calculate P0
    Jobs:
        a) Select empty memory row
        b) Place grain in 'Reserved' cell
        -when reserved:
        c) Place grain in 'P' cell
        d) Place grain in '0' index cell
        -if A0 != 0:
        e) Place grain in input 1 of XOR gate
        -if B0 != 0:
        f) Place grain in input 2 of XOR gate
        g) 'Operate' gate
        -if output != 0:
        h) Place grain in 'value' column of reserved memory row.
        -if output == 0:
        i) Do nothing
        -Finalize memory entry:
        j) Place grain in 'read ready' column of memory row.

Same for P1-P3

For each condition Pi available:

4. Calculate G0
    a) Select empty memory row
    b) Place grain in 'Reserved' cell
    -when reserved:
    c) Place grain in 'G' cell
    d) Place grain in '0' index cell
    -if A0 != 0:
    e) Place grain in AND input 1
    -if B0 != 0:
    f) Place grain in AND input 2
    g) 'Operate' gate
    -if output != 0:
    h) Place grain in 'value' cell of memory row
    -if output == 0:
    i) Do nothing
    -Finalize memory entry:
    j) Place grain in 'read ready' cell of memory row
